	<h3>The Big Hack</h3>
		<p>"The Big Hack" article described a scenario in New York City under attack of multiple hackers.  It explains events that multiple cybersecurity experts, hackers, and government official believe that can happen or events that already happened. Then imagine if all these scenarios happen at the same time in such big city as New York City. 
		The article starts out with hacking multiple SUV to veer off causing numerous accidents in high traffic areas in the city. The 911 operator believed the issue to be just the normal every day accidents and didn't chalk it up as bigger issue.   Normally the police would have been assigned to these accidents and help route traffic but the police station software was also hacked causing major delays responding to accidents and coordinating with other government officials.  
		As hospitals were trying to treat the numerous car accident injuries the hospitals network was also hacked. They were unable to login into their machines and this caused many delays on checking people in, performing routine procedures, and checking people out. Doctors that relied on their computer couldn't give prescriptions and had to learn/relies on the older doctor's experience to do improvised paper-record keeping. 
		The next question is where were the government U.S officials for preventing cybersecurity attacks? As the numerous incidents kept adding up the head of cybersecurity begun connecting the dots but it took till noon to issue warning out to New York City.  Shortly after the warning went out the power plants was also affected causing multiple subway cars carrying thousands of passengers to be stuck or forced to walk through the subway. 
		I believe this article described the many cybersecurity threats that have occurred or can possibly happen. It explained the potential of group of hackers planning well-coordinated attack that crippled major city in hours. It also leads to the question is the United States this vulnerable to attacks as it's hard to believe in software we can't physically see and knowing that these hacks have happened in the past but on much smaller scale.
